Tap a key, speak, and clean text lands in whatever Mac app has focus — think
the built-in macOS dictation, but fast, accurate, and working everywhere you
can type.

To _blurt_ is to say something suddenly, without stopping to think — which is
more or less what this app lets you do to your Mac.

Built entirely native (AppKit + SwiftUI — no Electron, no web views). The whole
pipeline lives in **BlurtEngine**, a dependency-free Swift 6 package: mic
capture, one synchronous `POST` to
[AssemblyAI's dictation API](https://www.assemblyai.com), and a clipboard paste
into the focused app. No local models, no upload-then-poll job queue, no
background daemons — audio in, polished text out, one HTTP request per
utterance.

## Features

- **Works anywhere you can type** — the transcript is pasted into the focused
  app via a synthesized ⌘V, with your prior clipboard contents saved and
  restored around it. If the target app quit while you were speaking, the text
  stays on the clipboard instead of vanishing.
- **One key, no chords** — dictation is triggered by a single lone modifier
  (right ⌘ by default; right ⌥ also available). Tap to toggle, hold
  for push-to-talk. The event tap swallows nothing: a lone modifier types
  nothing anyway, and combos like ⌘C pass through untouched.
- **Polished in one step** — each utterance rides to AssemblyAI's dictation API
  with a little context and nothing more; the same call runs a server-side LLM
  cleanup (disfluencies out, punctuation fixed), so the text comes back already
  polished. No second request, no model downloads. The context is what makes the
  transcript continue naturally — your recent dictations and the text just before
  your cursor — and nothing else about your screen goes with it: not the app, not
  the window title, not the field, not your selection. See
  [Privacy](#privacy).
- **Fast** — transcription and cleanup share one round trip that typically
  finishes in about a second. Blurt pre-warms the HTTPS connection while
  you're still speaking and flips to "transcribing" at key-up, so polished
  text lands moments after you stop talking.
- **Accurate** —
  [30% fewer hallucinations than Whisper](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/pre-recorded-audio/benchmarks)
  on AssemblyAI's published benchmarks.
- **Multilingual** — works in 18 languages, detected automatically, and you
  can code-switch mid-sentence.
- **Escape to throw it away** — press <kbd>esc</kbd> and the dictation is
  cancelled: while you're still speaking, or after, right up until the text
  lands. Nothing is transcribed and nothing is pasted. Escape isn't swallowed,
  so it still reaches whatever app you're in.
- **Quiets your music** — start dictating and Spotify or Apple Music pauses,
  then resumes the moment you stop. Only ever pauses a player that's already
  playing, so it can't start music you didn't ask for. Browser audio isn't
  covered: nothing on macOS will tell an app whether a browser tab is playing,
  and pausing blindly would start playback as often as it stopped it.
- **Live feedback** — a floating overlay pill shows a real-time mic level
  meter and the pipeline phase; a menu bar indicator mirrors it from anywhere.
- **Actual synth cues** — start and stop can be cued by real Yamaha DX7 or
  Roland Juno-106 sounds, or turned off.
- **Guided setup** — a first-run wizard walks through Microphone permission,
  Accessibility trust, and your API key; the same window later hosts settings
  for the trigger key, key terms, and sound pack.
- **No surprises** — installing an update is always yours to do: Blurt looks for
  a newer release once a day (and whenever you ask) and, if there is one, offers
  to open the DMG — it never replaces itself. There's no telemetry of any kind.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 15+ (macOS 26 recommended — enables the Liquid
  Glass UI)
- An [AssemblyAI API key](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys)
  (free tier available)

## Install

1. [Download **Blurt.dmg**](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/blurt/releases/latest/download/Blurt.dmg).
2. Open the disk image and drag **Blurt.app** into `Applications`.

## Getting started

From a fresh install to dictated text in your editor:

1. **Launch Blurt** — the setup wizard requests Microphone and Accessibility
   permissions and asks for your
   [AssemblyAI API key](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys).
2. **Click into any text field** — a document, a chat box, a terminal.
3. **Tap right ⌘ and speak** — the overlay pill shows the live mic level. Tap
   again to stop, or hold the key and release for push-to-talk.
4. **Read what you said** — the polished transcript is pasted at your cursor.
5. **Tune it** — open Settings to change the trigger key or pick a synth sound
   pack.

## Privacy

Blurt stores your API key in the macOS Keychain. Audio is captured only while
you are dictating, then sent over HTTPS to AssemblyAI for transcription.

The request also carries context, so the transcript continues naturally from what
came before: your recent dictations from this session, and a short run of the text
immediately before your cursor — never the contents of a password field, which
Blurt refuses to read. Anything you dictate _into_ a password field is likewise
never kept as context. Your key terms from Settings ride along too, to bias
spelling. Nothing else about your screen is sent: not the app you are in, not the
window title, not the field you are typing in, not what you have selected.

That recent-dictation history lives in memory only — it is never written to disk,
it is cleared when you quit Blurt, and it is capped (100 dictations, and about
4096 characters per request, oldest dropped first). Note what it means while Blurt
is running: text you dictated in one app can be sent as context with a later
dictation in another. Quit and reopen Blurt to clear it. Blurt stores no audio and
no transcripts, and sends no telemetry — no crash reporting, no analytics, no
usage tracking.

Because transcription is processed by AssemblyAI, their
[Privacy Policy](https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/privacy-policy) and
[Terms of Service](https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/terms-of-service) apply to
that audio.

## Build from source

Blurt is MIT-licensed and needs only Xcode and Homebrew to build:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap.sh   # install the local toolchain
scripts/dev-build.sh   # build + install "Blurt Dev" to /Applications
scripts/check.sh       # full repo health check — the same script CI runs
swift test             # engine unit tests only
```

`dev-build.sh` installs to `/Applications` on purpose: macOS won't register
Accessibility/Input-Monitoring permissions for apps living in build
directories, so the app needs a stable install path to be usable at all. It
installs as `Blurt Dev.app` under its own bundle id, so it sits beside a
released Blurt instead of replacing it.
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full local setup — prerequisites,
what each script does, signing — and how changes land;
[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) has the architecture notes.

## Architecture

```text
Sources/BlurtEngine/     Swift 6 package owning the pipeline — no external dependencies
  Audio/                 MicCapture: fresh AVAudioRecorder per session, 16 kHz mono PCM,
                         live level meter; DX7/Juno-106 sound packs
  STT/                   AssemblyAITranscriber: one POST to dictation.assemblyai.com/transcribe
                         (STT + LLM rewrite); ConversationContext (contextual priming:
                         your recent dictations then the text before the cursor, and
                         nothing else about your screen); KeytermsBoost (key terms as
                         the word-boost list)
  Pipeline/              DictationSession actor: press/release/cancel commands, phase
                         stream, auto-release before the API's recording cap
  Hotkey/                DictationKeyGate/Router: pure, unit-tested state machine for the
                         lone-modifier trigger (tap vs hold vs combo)
  Injection/             KeyInjector: save clipboard → paste via synthesized ⌘V → restore
  FocusCapture/          Accessibility reads of the focused app/window/field, kept local:
                         paste spacing and the developer-mode log
  Config/, Update/       Keychain API-key store, key terms, download-only release check

App/Blurt/               AppKit/SwiftUI shell (Xcode project generated by XcodeGen)
  AppCoordinator.swift   the one place the engine is composed for the real app
  Hotkey/                DictationKeyTap: the CGEventTap feeding the engine's key gate
  Overlay/, MenuBar/     floating status pill, menu bar dictation indicator
  Wizard/                setup wizard + settings window
```

The engine is a standalone package you can embed to build your own dictation
app — mic capture, dictation-API transcription, and paste-into-the-focused-app behind
three protocol seams, fully stubbed in tests.
[`Sources/BlurtEngine/README.md`](./Sources/BlurtEngine/README.md) is the
developer guide.

Latency note: perceived speed is mostly bookkeeping. `press()` warms up the
HTTPS connection and kicks off the focused-field context read without awaiting
either; `release()` claims the "transcribing" state before the recording is
even read back from disk — so the stop cue fires at key-up, not after I/O.
