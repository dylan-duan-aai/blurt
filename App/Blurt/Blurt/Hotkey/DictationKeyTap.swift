/// Drives the single lone-modifier dictation trigger from a `CGEventTap`.
///
/// Watches `flagsChanged` for the bound modifier (e.g. right ⌘, keycode 54) to
/// detect down/up, and `keyDown` for any *other* key to spot a modifier combo
/// (⌘C, ⌘V…) or an Escape cancel. The per-event decision lives in the engine —
/// `DictationKeyRouter` (keycode relevance, down/up edge dedup, Escape routing)
/// over `DictationKeyGate` (tap/hold semantics) — so this type only reduces each
/// `CGEvent` to a router event and owns the tap lifecycle.
///
/// Unlike the old chord trigger, this **swallows nothing**: a lone modifier
/// types nothing into the focused app, and combos must pass through so normal
/// shortcuts keep working. That includes the Escape cancel — cancelling a
/// dictation does *not* consume the keystroke, so Escape still reaches whatever
/// is focused. Making it exclusive would mean an active tap, which the paragraph
/// below rules out. The tap is therefore created `.listenOnly` — an
/// active (`.defaultTap`) tap would make macOS synchronously wait on this
/// process before delivering every keystroke system-wide, so any main-thread
/// stall in Blurt would add typing latency in *other* apps.
///
/// Main-actor (via the app target's default isolation) because everything here
/// already runs on the main thread: the tap's run-loop source is added to the
/// main run loop (`ensureRunning`), so the C callback fires there, and the
/// coordinator/UITest entry points are main-actor. Isolation lets the compiler
/// prove single-threaded access to the router state instead of guarding it with
/// a hand-held lock.
