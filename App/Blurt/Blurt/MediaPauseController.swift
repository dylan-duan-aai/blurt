/// Quiets the user's music while a dictation is recording and restores it
/// afterwards, so what you're listening to doesn't end up in the microphone feed —
/// and in the transcript.
///
/// Driven from `AppCoordinator.render(_:)` on every phase, exactly like
/// `CueSoundPlayer`: the edge logic is the engine's `RecordingEdgeDetector` (shared
/// with the chimes, unit-tested there), and this type is only the AppKit-side
/// executor. Restore rides the recording→not-recording edge rather than a terminal
/// phase, so playback returns the moment the mic closes instead of a second later
/// when the paste lands.
///
/// Only the scriptable players (`MediaPlayerApp`: Spotify, Apple Music) are touched,
/// and only *precisely*: each exposes `player state`, so we pause one that is
/// already playing and resume only what we actually paused. `if application … is
/// running` is the scripting idiom that reads the running state *without* launching
/// the app, which matters — a dictation must never boot a music player. Because it
/// cannot start anything unbidden, the switch defaults on.
///
/// Browsers are deliberately out of scope; `MediaPlayerApp` documents the detection
/// routes that were measured and rejected, and the blind media-key fallback that was
/// built, tested in real use, and removed for toggling rather than pausing.
///
/// ## Why the scripts run in `/usr/bin/osascript` rather than `NSAppleScript`
///
/// This began as in-process `NSAppleScript`, and `scripts/leaks.sh` failed on it
/// twice: the leak backtraces ran through `executeAndReturnError`, so the OSA
/// machinery leaks internally per invocation. Wrapping the call in an
/// `autoreleasepool` did **not** fix it — the second failure's backtrace ran
/// straight *through* the pool — and the leak never reproduced on a dev machine,
/// only on CI, leaving no way to validate an in-process fix.
///
/// Running the script in a short-lived child makes the fix structural instead of
/// hopeful: the OSA allocations happen inside `osascript` and die with it, so no
/// Blurt frame can appear in a leak backtrace for this code. `Process` against a
/// system binary is already established here — `SigningIdentity` shells out to
/// `tccutil` the same way. TCC still attributes the Apple Event to Blurt as the
/// *responsible* process, so the consent prompt names Blurt and reads Blurt's
/// `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` — don't remove that key.
///
/// One `osascript` per edge, not one per player: AppleScript can't take
/// app-specific terminology like `player state` through a variable application
/// reference, so both players are unrolled into a single generated script.
