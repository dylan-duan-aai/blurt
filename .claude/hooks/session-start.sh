# SessionStart hook: prepare a Claude Code on the web (Linux) sandbox.
#
# Blurt is macOS-only, so the Swift toolchain can't run here — but the portable
# checks (prettier / xmllint / markdownlint / shellcheck / actionlint / zizmor /
# shfmt / release.test.sh) can. This hook installs the missing portable linters so
# `scripts/check.sh --portable` works, then prints a one-line preflight so the
# session starts knowing CI (macos-26) is the authority on green.
#
# Local (macOS) sessions are untouched: the hook exits immediately unless
# CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true. Idempotent — every install is guarded on
# `command -v`, so a warm (cached) container skips straight through. Installs
# degrade to a note rather than failing the hook: the portable check skips
# absent tools the same way check.sh always has.
#
# SwiftLint and swift-format are NOT installed: their Linux builds ship as
# GitHub release binaries, which the default web network policy blocks (only
# npm / apt / the Go module proxy are reachable). Swift formatting and lint
# therefore stay a CI concern on the web — the PostToolUse hooks no-op cleanly
# when the tools are absent.
