/// (the same split as `OverlayUIState`). In-memory only: it starts empty each
/// launch and is never written to disk.
///
/// **It holds far more than it shows.** `capacity` is the history depth;
/// `displayCapacity` is how many rows the ready window's "Recent" list renders.
/// The deep end exists because a dictation's recent history is also request
/// context — `ConversationContext` sends the user's recent utterances as the
/// leading `conversation_context` turns, so "how many do we remember" is a
/// question about transcription quality, not about how tall a list looks.
