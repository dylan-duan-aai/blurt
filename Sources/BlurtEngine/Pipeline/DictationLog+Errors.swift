// `.failed` is appended to a sibling `errors.jsonl`. Split from

// encoder, and `appendLine`) because the two files answer different questions —
// "what did users say" versus "what broke".

// dictations log is a prompt-iteration corpus whose every line is expected to
// carry a `transcript`, and interleaving transcript-less error rows would break
