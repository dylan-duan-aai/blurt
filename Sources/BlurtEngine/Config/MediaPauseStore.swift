/// **Browsers are deliberately not covered** — see `MediaPlayerApp` for the three

/// Both entries share one vocabulary — `player state`, `pause`, `play` — so a
/// single script shape covers them and only the application name differs.
/// Deliberately a closed enum rather than a configurable list: each addition needs
/// its scripting dictionary verified (Spotify's command codes are
/// `spfyPaus`/`spfyPlay`, Apple Music's `hookPaus`/`hookPlay`, both exposing
/// `player state` as `pPlS`), and each one costs the user another
/// automation-consent prompt.
///
/// ## Why browsers (YouTube) are not here, and shouldn't be added
///
/// Pausing safely requires *knowing* something is playing — otherwise "pause"
/// starts music the user never asked for. No public API answers that for a browser.
/// All three routes were measured on macOS 26 and rejected:
///
/// - **CoreAudio, device level** (`kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere`):
///   read `true` with the app quit and total silence. Useless.
/// - **CoreAudio, per process** (`kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningOutput`, public
///   since macOS 14.4): enumerates processes, but reports nothing for *other*
///   processes without system-audio-recording consent — a far heavier permission
///   than the feature is worth, and worse UX than the automation prompt.
/// - **MediaRemote** (`MRMediaRemoteGetNowPlayingApplicationIsPlaying`): private,
///   and now gated — it returned `false`, and `nowPlayingInfo` nil, while Spotify
///   was demonstrably playing. Re-confirmed from a signed `.app` bundle, so
///   bundling is not the missing piece.
///
/// A blind system play/pause media key (the only thing that *reaches* a browser)
/// was therefore built as an opt-in fallback, tested in real use, and **removed**:
/// with no way to check state it toggles rather than pauses, so it started playback
/// that wasn't running. The honest routes left are a browser extension with native
/// messaging (precise, no user setup, but a product-sized lift) or
/// `execute javascript` / `do JavaScript` (precise, but each browser needs "Allow
/// JavaScript from Apple Events" enabled — verified blocked by default, Chromium
/// error 12). Don't reintroduce a blind toggle.
