/// disagrees with `tccd`: recording the *Team ID* did, because a release
/// (Developer ID, codesign's default requirement) and a dev build (Apple
/// Development, an explicit team-based requirement) share a team while pinning
/// different requirements, so installing one over the other read as "unchanged"
/// and stranded the user on the wizard's Accessibility step. Debug builds now
/// carry their own bundle id, so that particular collision can't recur — but the
/// requirement is still what `tccd` compares, and it still moves without warning
/// when the **release** certificate is re-issued (`RELEASE.md`'s rotation
/// procedure), orphaning the grant of every installed user at once. That is the
/// case this exists for now, and nothing at signing time can pre-empt it: the
/// requirement a shipped copy handed to `tccd` was written before the rotation.

/// current identity, the live trust state, and the reset side effect.
