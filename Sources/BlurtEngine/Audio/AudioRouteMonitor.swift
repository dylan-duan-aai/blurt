/// Ticks whenever the system's audio **output** route changes in a way that

///
/// This exists for the record cue chimes. `CueSoundPlayer` decodes and
/// `prepareToPlay()`s them once at launch so the first chime never stalls the
/// pill — but that pre-roll is bound to the output route it was made against,
/// and Blurt's own capture is what invalidates it: opening the mic flips AirPods
/// out of their output-only profile into the bidirectional one, which drops the
/// output format underneath the primed players. The first chime after such a
/// flip is exactly the one that stalls, which is the chime at the start of a
/// dictation.
///
/// Two properties are watched, because "the route changed" has two shapes:
///
/// - `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice` on the system object — the user
///   switched output devices (built-in speakers → AirPods).
/// - `kAudioDevicePropertyNominalSampleRate` on whichever device is *currently*
///   default — the same device renegotiated its format, which is what the
///   profile flip looks like from CoreAudio. That listener is re-targeted
///   whenever the first one fires, so it always tracks the live device.
///
/// Public because the app owns the cue players; the engine's own use of
/// CoreAudio routing (`AudioRoute`) stays internal.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` because the listener registrations below are confined
/// to `queue` rather than protected by a lock — see their declarations.

  ///
  /// A `queue.sync` here can self-deadlock. The listener blocks capture `self`

  /// deadlocks against itself.

  /// the last reference is gone, so no block can be *inside* its `guard let self`
