/// Read-only queries against the system's current audio routing — the two facts
/// about the mic that `AVFoundation` doesn't expose but the capture path needs:
///
/// 1. **Which device is the default input**, so `MicCapture` can tell whether a
///    recorder it prepared earlier is still bound to the device the user is
///    about to speak into. `AVAudioRecorder` resolves the route at
///    `prepareToRecord()` time and never re-resolves it, so a recorder warmed
///    before the user connected their AirPods would silently record from the
///    built-in mic.
/// 2. **What transport that device is on**, since a Bluetooth link is both slow
///    to bring up (the wait `MicLiveness` caps) and buffered at the tail (the
///    linger `MicCapture.stop()` grants rather than truncating).
///
/// Raw reads only — no policy. What a transport type *means* lives in
/// `AudioTransport` and `MicLiveness`, which are pure and unit-tested; this file
/// needs real hardware to answer anything, so it is excluded from the coverage
/// gate and must not be where a decision hides.
///
/// Internal, not public: the app never asks these directly (it observes route
/// *changes* through `AudioRouteMonitor`), and `.periphery.yml` runs with
/// `retain_public: false`, so a `public` symbol only the engine reaches fails
/// the unused-code scan.
