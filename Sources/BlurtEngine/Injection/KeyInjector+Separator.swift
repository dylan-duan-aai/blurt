// `KeyInjector`'s separator decision: the pure text rules for joining a new
// dictation onto whatever already sits before the caret. Split out of
// `KeyInjector.swift` to stay within the lint file-length budget, on the seam its
// tests already use — `KeyInjectorLeadingSeparatorTests` and the
// `KeyInjector.separatorBasis` suite cover exactly these two functions, and
// neither touches the pasteboard, the event system, or the actor's state.
// `resolveInsert`, which composes them with the window-identity decision, stays
// beside that state in `KeyInjector.swift` (it needs `pid_t`, and this file
// deliberately imports nothing).

  /// when there's preceding text (`priorText`) that doesn't already end in
  /// whitespace; leaves `text` untouched for an empty/unknown field or when the
  /// caret already follows whitespace.
  ///
  /// A leading separator beats a trailing one: a trailing space dangles at the end
  /// of a paste where many text engines trim or collapse it (so the next paste
  /// abuts the previous text), whereas a leading space lands *between* the two
  /// chunks where nothing strips it. `priorText` is nil for empty fields and for
  /// secure/Accessibility-opaque fields — there we can't tell what precedes the
  /// caret, so we add no separator rather than risk a stray leading space.

  /// Code — or a browser tab like Google Docs, whose canvas-rendered body is just
  /// as opaque) — we can't tell those apart from AX alone, so we fall back to the

  /// as last time (see `WindowIdentity`): that's the in-progress-run case where
  /// our own paste is what now sits before the caret. This is deliberately
  /// app-agnostic rather than an allowlist of "known opaque editors": a window
  /// match is a reasonable proxy for "still the same document" across *any* app,
  /// opaque or not, whereas a shared process id alone isn't (one browser process
  /// hosts many unrelated tabs/documents). Otherwise (a different window or
  /// nothing pasted yet) we return nil rather than risk a stray leading space
