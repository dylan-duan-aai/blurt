/// Everything captured at dictation start about where the user is typing:

/// **Most of it never leaves the machine.** Only `recentTranscripts` and
/// `priorText` go on the wire, as the request's `conversation_context` turns
/// (`ConversationContext.turns`), and `keyTerms` rides a separate request field.
/// The rest is collected for local work — paste spacing, the injector's window
/// identity, the developer-mode log — and each field below says which it is. A
/// field's presence here is not permission to send it; widening what is sent is
/// a deliberate decision, not a wiring detail.
///
/// Every field is optional or empty-able: whichever is available is used, and an
/// entirely empty context sends no context at all (the model then works from the
/// audio alone).

  /// name, a Slack channel). **Local only, not sent** — it is the most
  /// revealing signal captured. `KeyInjector` uses it to recognize the captured
  /// window (a browser hosts many unrelated tabs under one PID), and the
  /// developer-mode log records it.
