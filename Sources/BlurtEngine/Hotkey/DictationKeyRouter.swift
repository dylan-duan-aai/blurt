///
/// - **Edge dedup.** `flagsChanged` deliveries re-report the bound key's flag
///   bit whether or not it changed, so the router tracks the modifier's current
///   physical state and only a genuine down/up *edge* reaches the gate —
///   repeated same-state deliveries must not double-fire a dictation.
/// - **Relevance.** Only the bound keycode's flag changes drive the modifier;
///   a `keyDown` for any *other* key marks a combo (e.g. ⌘C over the held
///   trigger), and the trigger's own keycode never counts as a combo.
/// - **Cancel.** Escape is not a combo but a discard: it cancels a dictation
///   anywhere in flight, including the transcribe/inject window the gate has
///   already forgotten about (see `dictationIsActive`).
/// - **Dropped-event recovery.** After the host's tap is disabled and re-enabled,
///   whether the gate's state survives depends on the trigger still being held —
///   see `recoverFromDroppedEvents(triggerStillHeld:)`.

/// — so every decision is deterministic and unit-testable. The app-side
/// `DictationKeyTap` reduces each `CGEvent` to an `Event` and forwards it here.
