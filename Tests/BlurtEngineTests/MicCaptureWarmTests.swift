/// Gated on BLURT_LIVE_AUDIO_TESTS=1, like `MicCaptureLevelsTests`, because every
/// test here goes through `MicCapture.makeRecorder()` — and that calls
/// `prepareToRecord()`, which is *the* route-activation call this whole change is
/// about. On a runner with no input device it is not merely unreliable, it is
/// hostile: it blocks the calling thread rather than suspending, so several of
/// these running concurrently occupy the cooperative pool and wedge the entire
/// `swift test` run, not just this suite. That is not a hypothetical — an
/// ungated first attempt failed three expectations here and then hung 171
/// unrelated tests until the job's 30-minute timeout killed it.
///
/// So this suite documents and locks the warm lifecycle for a human running it
/// on a real Mac with a real microphone; `MicCapture+Warm.swift` is excluded
/// from the coverage gate for the same reason `MicCapture.swift` is.
