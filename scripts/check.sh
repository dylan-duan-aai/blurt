#
# Everything this script runs before `swift test` is read-only and independent:
# no step's input is another step's output, so there is no ordering reason for
# the first failure to hide the rest. Under a plain `set -e` it hid all of them —
# a single pending swift-format reflow ended the run before swiftlint,
# actionlint, zizmor, prettier, markdownlint, shellcheck, shfmt, ruff and pytest
# had said anything. That is the same complaint the reordering comment further
# down makes about the build ("their findings arrived one red run at a time"),
# and reordering only fixed the half of it that was the build's fault.
#
# So: `run_check` records a failure and keeps going, and the run exits non-zero
# at the very bottom with the whole list. It is the same shape the checks already
# use internally — the dependency guard and the sound catalog each tally
# violations and report them in one pass instead of exiting at the first.
#
# It stays scoped to the read-only checks. The Swift build, the coverage gate,
# the sanitizers, the app build and the integration steps remain fail-fast,
# because there the dependency is real: a failed build leaves nothing for the
# next step to measure, and continuing would produce noise, not findings.

  # Exclusions (so the figure reflects deterministically-testable engine code):
  #  - Tests/            : test files themselves, not shipping code.
  #  - MicCapture.swift  : the AVAudioRecorder capture actor. It needs a real
  #                        audio device, so it can't run in CI (its integration
  #                        test, MicCaptureLevelsTests, is env-gated for the same
  #                        reason). Its pure meter math lives in
  #                        MicCapture+Meter.swift, which IS covered. Keep this
  #                        list tight — exclude only code that genuinely cannot
  #                        be exercised without hardware.
  #  - MicCapture+Warm.swift : the same actor's warm-recorder lifecycle, split
  #                        out of MicCapture.swift only for the lint file-length
  #                        budget. Every path through it runs makeRecorder(),
  #                        i.e. prepareToRecord() — the route-activation call, the
  #                        one thing here that genuinely needs a device. Unlike
  #                        +Meter (pure math, covered), splitting this out moved
  #                        hardware-bound code onto the counted side by accident:
  #                        the pattern above pins a literal filename. Trying to
  #                        cover it in CI didn't merely fail, it deadlocked the
  #                        whole test run — prepareToRecord blocks its thread
  #                        instead of suspending, so concurrent attempts drained
  #                        the cooperative pool. Its suite is env-gated alongside
  #                        MicCaptureLevelsTests. The transport and liveness
  #                        *policy* it consults stays covered, in AudioTransport
  #                        and MicLiveness.
  #  - AudioRoute(Monitor).swift : the CoreAudio routing reads (AudioRoute) and the
  #                        property listeners (AudioRouteMonitor). Both answer
  #                        questions only real hardware can answer — which device
  #                        is default, whether its transport is Bluetooth, and
  #                        when the user switches output — and the listener half
  #                        can only fire on an actual route change. Same
