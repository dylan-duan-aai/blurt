# The mechanical half of AGENTS.md's "Settled decisions — don't reintroduce these".
#
# Every entry in that table was tried the other way and reverted, and until now
# each one was enforced only by a reader remembering it: the table is prose, and
# `.claude/skills/project-guardrails` is the same prose compressed. That is
# enforcement exactly as long as attention holds — and the failure mode is a
# reviewer nodding through the one line that re-adds `AVAudioEngine` capture or
# an `LSUIElement` key.
#
# This file carries the subset of that table a regex can decide. It is not the
# whole table and cannot be: some entries are structural (the SPM-dependency
# guard parses project.yml's `packages:` block, so it stays in check.sh), some
# are already mechanized elsewhere (the pbxproj drift check, the PreToolUse
# hook), and some are genuinely undecidable from a grep — the "no filler-word
# clause" rule is about the *transcription prompt*, while `CleanupInstruction`'s
# rewrite instruction legitimately names filler sounds, and no pattern separates
# those two without also flagging the correct one. A rule that fires on correct
# code gets routed around, so those stay prose and stay in review.
#
# Shape is deliberately `check-portability.sh`'s: parallel pattern/advice arrays,
# a per-rule probe asserted by `--self-test`, and an escape hatch. The two gates
# answer the same kind of question — "does this tree contain a construct we
# decided against?" — so they should be read and extended the same way.
#
# Escape hatch: end the line with `// invariant-ok: <reason>` (or `# invariant-ok:`
# in yml/plist) when a flagged line is genuinely intended. Whole-line comments are
# skipped, so prose *about* a settled decision — which the sources carry a lot of,
# since each one documents why it is what it is — doesn't trip the gate.
#
# Every rule is also pinned to the prose it enforces, in both AGENTS.md's table
# and the guardrails skill: `--self-test` fails if either row goes missing. The
# rows move — PR #132 rewrote the `config.prompt` and language entries — and a
# rule outliving its row is the one failure this file cannot survive. It would
# still fire, still cite AGENTS.md, and still sound authoritative while enforcing
# a decision the project had reversed, which is strictly worse than the prose it
# replaced: prose that no longer reflects the design gets read and ignored, a
# gate that no longer reflects the design blocks the change that reflects it.
# Pinning both files also makes CLAUDE.md's "keep the two in agreement" — until
# now enforced by nobody — cost one grep.
#
# Adding a rule: put the pattern, the scope, the advice, a known-bad probe, and
# the two anchors at the SAME index in the six arrays. The self-test and the
# length assertion below are what keep a half-added rule from looking like a
# clean tree.

# Scopes are git pathspecs, word-split at use. They are load-bearing, not
# decoration: most of these terms appear legitimately somewhere in the repo, and
# the scope is what separates "the engine sends this field" from "a test asserts
# it is absent". `language_code` is the clearest case — `KeytermsWireTests`
# contains `#expect(object.keys.contains("language_code") == false)`, which is
# the invariant being *enforced*, so the rule looks at Sources/ only.
#
# The generated Xcode project is excluded everywhere: it is derived from
# project.yml (check.sh fails on drift), so scanning it would report every
# finding twice and invite a fix in the file that gets overwritten.
#
# Scopes name file *types*, not just directories, because these rules are about
# code and a directory holds more than code. `Sources` was all Swift until
# PR #137 moved BLURTENGINE.md to Sources/BlurtEngine/README.md — a document
# whose job is to explain these very decisions ("Do not replace this with a
# long-lived AVAudioEngine/installTap graph"). Prose about a rule is not a
# violation of it, and the whole-line-comment filter below can't help: a
# Markdown paragraph isn't a comment in any language grep knows. Restricting to
# code extensions also keeps the app scope off the .png and .m4a resources it
# was otherwise grepping byte by byte.
