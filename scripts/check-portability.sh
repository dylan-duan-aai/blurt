# Flag GNU-only shell idioms in scripts/ and .claude/hooks/.
#
# These scripts run in two places with different userlands: a developer's Mac and
# CI (macos-26) get BSD coreutils, while a Linux / web sandbox gets GNU. An idiom
# that only exists in GNU therefore works everywhere the change is written and
# fails everywhere it ships. PR #116 paid for exactly that — "Fix the sitemap
# <loc> strip on BSD sed (macOS CI)" — and shellcheck does not look for it,
# because nothing here is wrong as shell, only wrong as *portable* shell.
#
# Scope is deliberately scripts/ and .claude/hooks/ only. Workflow `run:` blocks
# are excluded: several jobs run on ubuntu-latest, where GNU is the correct
# assumption, so gating them would flag working code.
#
# Escape hatch: end the line with `# portable-ok: <reason>` when a flagged idiom
# is genuinely portable or genuinely intended. Lines that are entirely a comment
# are skipped, so prose *about* an idiom (release.test.sh discusses `sort -V`)
# doesn't trip the gate.
#
# Not exhaustive, and not trying to be — it carries the divergences that have bitten
# this repo or are one typo away from doing so. Add to the table as they turn up.

# Two parallel arrays rather than one "pattern|advice" list, because the patterns
# themselves contain `|` (regex alternation) — splitting on the first one truncates
# the pattern mid-expression, and a truncated regex is a rule that silently never
# matches. Kept honest by the self-test at the bottom of this file.
#
# `sed -i` is the subtle entry: GNU treats the backup suffix as optional, BSD
# requires it, so bare `sed -i` edits in place on Linux and eats the next argument
# as the suffix on macOS. The pattern therefore matches -i only when nothing
# follows it, leaving the portable `sed -i.bak` form alone.
