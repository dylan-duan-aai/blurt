# --- Where the signing key comes from -----------------------------------------
# Two custody models, one build script:
#
#   CI    — BLURT_SIGNING_P12_BASE64 carries the Developer ID cert + key as a
#           base64 .p12 secret. It is imported into an EPHEMERAL keychain that
#           exists only for this run and is deleted on exit, so the key never
#           lands in a persistent store on the runner.
#   Local — a dedicated keychain that stays LOCKED at rest instead of living in
#           login. Unlocked for the duration of the build and re-locked on exit.
#           If that keychain isn't present — a machine that still keeps the key
#           in login, or mid-migration — fall through to whatever's already on
#           the search list so releases keep working.

#      runner, not something to adopt on a shared machine.

# Defense against silent DMG corruption: mount the image, check the bundle
# inside is signed and stapled, then eject. We pick our own mount point so
# we don't have to parse hdiutil's output (which reports /private/tmp/...
# rather than /tmp/... on macOS).
# Assigning MOUNT_POINT is what arms the unmount: `cleanup` (already the EXIT
# trap) detaches whatever it names, so a failure between here and the detach
# below can't leave the image attached.

  In CI the release workflow uploads these as run artifacts and the gated
  publish job takes it from here. Running locally, install to test and publish:
    scripts/release-install.sh    # install the notarized build to /Applications
    scripts/release-publish.sh    # tag, push, publish the GitHub Release
