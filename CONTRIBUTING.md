# Contributing to Blurt

Thanks for taking a look. Blurt is a small, open-source macOS dictation app, and
contributions of all sizes are welcome — bug reports, fixes, docs, or a new idea.

## Before you start

Blurt is **macOS-only** (Apple Silicon, AppKit + AVFoundation). You need a Mac
with Xcode to build, test, or run it — see [Local setup](#local-setup) below.
On Linux you can still read and edit the Swift source, but you can't build or
verify it locally; CI on `macos-26` is the authority on green.

[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) is the canonical guide to how the code is laid out —
the engine package, the AppKit shell, the dictation pipeline, and the
intentional design decisions behind them. Read it before a non-trivial change so
you don't reintroduce something that was deliberately removed.

## Local setup

You'll need:

- An **Apple Silicon Mac** on macOS 15+ (26 recommended).
- **Xcode 26+** — the full app, not just the Command Line Tools.
  `xcode-select -p` should print a path inside `Xcode.app`; if it doesn't, run
  `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`.
- **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)**, which `bootstrap.sh` uses to install
  everything else.
- An **[AssemblyAI API key](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys)**
  (free tier is plenty) if you want to actually dictate with your build. Blurt's
  setup wizard asks for it on first launch and stores it in the Keychain.

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AssemblyAI/blurt.git
cd blurt
scripts/bootstrap.sh        # install the toolchain from Brewfile
scripts/dev-build.sh        # build Blurt and install it to /Applications
open -a "Blurt Dev"
```

That's the whole setup. Everything else is one of these scripts:

| Script                        | What it does                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/bootstrap.sh`        | `brew bundle` from `Brewfile` — xcodegen, swiftlint, prettier, shellcheck, markdownlint, periphery, xcbeautify |
| `scripts/dev-build.sh`        | Clean signed `Debug-Local` build, installed as `/Applications/Blurt Dev.app`. The everyday loop.               |
| `scripts/check.sh`            | The full health check CI runs. The source of truth for "is this green?"                                        |
| `scripts/check.sh --portable` | Just the platform-independent subset (docs, site, scripts, workflows) — the part that runs off a Mac           |
| `swift test`                  | Engine unit tests only (Swift Testing), no app build                                                           |
| `scripts/uitest.sh`           | The XCUITest suite that drives the real app                                                                    |
| `scripts/leaks.sh`            | Whole-app leak check                                                                                           |

`dev-build.sh` installs to `/Applications` on purpose: macOS refuses to register
Accessibility and Input-Monitoring grants for an app living in a build
directory, so Blurt is unusable from DerivedData. It builds the `Debug-Local`
configuration — a debug build with the UI-test scaffolding compiled out, so it's
the real app.

### Dev builds are a separate app

Every debug configuration builds under the bundle id `dev.alex.blurt.dev` and
installs as **`/Applications/Blurt Dev.app`**; only `Release` is `dev.alex.blurt`
/ `Blurt.app`. So a dev build sits beside a released Blurt rather than replacing
it — you can run either, and each has its own Privacy & Security rows, its own
settings, and its own Dock icon. Grant "Blurt Dev" microphone and Accessibility
once; they stick across rebuilds.

They do share the Keychain item holding your AssemblyAI key, so you won't be
asked for it twice (macOS may ask once whether the other app may read it).

`scripts/reset-install.sh` wipes both.

### A note on signing

`dev-build.sh` signs with an **Apple Development** certificate from your login
keychain. Adding any Apple ID under Xcode → Settings → Accounts gets you one for
free. (The Developer ID release key is a different thing entirely and lives in a
separate, normally-locked keychain used only by releases — see
[`RELEASE.md`](./RELEASE.md).)

If you'd rather not set up a certificate, build ad-hoc signed instead:

```bash
xcodebuild -project App/Blurt/Blurt.xcodeproj -scheme Blurt \
  -configuration Debug-Local -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES build
```

That skips the `/Applications` install, and an ad-hoc signature changes on every
build — macOS keys the Accessibility grant to the signature, so you'd re-grant
permissions after each rebuild. (Blurt notices the signature changed and clears
the orphaned grant at launch; without that the Blurt Dev row stays switched on in
System Settings while the app keeps reporting it as denied.) Fine for checking
that a change compiles and launches; `dev-build.sh` is the better daily loop.

### After editing `App/Blurt/project.yml`

Run `xcodegen generate` and commit the regenerated `Blurt.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
alongside it. `check.sh` fails on drift between the two. Never hand-edit the
`.pbxproj` — it's generated.

### Working without a Mac

You can read and edit Swift, and `scripts/check.sh --portable` fully verifies
docs, site, script, and workflow changes. It skips the entire Swift side and
says so on its last line, so don't read a green portable run as "it builds" —
open the PR and let CI on `macos-26` answer that.

## Pull requests

- Branch off `main` and keep each PR focused on one thing.
- Make sure `scripts/check.sh` passes (or, if you're on Linux, say so in the PR
  and let CI verify).
- Match the surrounding code: 2-space indent, Swift Testing for tests, no new
  external dependencies in the engine.
- Write a clear description of what changed and why.

Every PR that touches code gets an **installable dev build**: CI builds
`Blurt.app` from your branch and a bot comments a download link, so a reviewer
can try the change rather than imagine it. The build is ad-hoc signed and not
notarized, so it needs its quarantine flag cleared, and its permissions granted
once per build — the comment spells out the commands.
