"""Scoring: how close did the cleanup get back to the reference?

Two word-error rates over the same alignment machinery:

- **content** — casefolded, punctuation-stripped. Measures whether the words the
  speaker meant survived and the disfluencies didn't. This is the axis the prompt
  is actually being tuned on, and the only one every corpus supports.
- **format** — tokens exactly as written. Adds capitalization and punctuation.
  Only meaningful on a corpus whose reference side carries them; `corpus.py`
  marks which sources qualify.

The default `blend` weights content 0.7 / format 0.3: punctuation differences are
numerous and mostly cosmetic, so scoring them equally would drown out the signal
about disfluency removal. `--metric content` or `--metric format` isolate either
axis when that's what you want to see.

This module is the bottom of the dependency chain — it imports nothing else in the
harness, so nothing about how a corpus was built can leak into how it is scored.

    """Turn a word error rate into a score: `1 - WER`, with a bounded tail below zero.

    WER is unbounded above — a hypothesis can add arbitrarily many words — so `1 - WER`
    is unbounded below and something has to bound it. This used to be `max(0, ...)`,
    which bounded it by **flattening** it: at WER 1.0, 2.9 and 4.3 the score was 0.000,
    0.000 and 0.000. Three very different failures, one number.

    That flattening lands exactly where it hurts. GEPA's Pareto front is per validation
    example, so on any example where a candidate degenerates, "looped until it hit
    max_tokens" and "reworded a clause badly" were indistinguishable — the front could
    not prefer the near-miss, and the search got no gradient out of catastrophe.

    So the tail decays instead of clipping:

        WER <= 1   ->  1 - WER          exactly as before, in [0, 1]
        WER >  1   ->  exp(1 - WER) - 1 strictly decreasing, approaching -1

    Nothing in the normal range moves — a run that scored 0.848 still scores 0.848, so
    every number measured before this change stays comparable. Only the region that was
    previously one flat line gains an ordering.

    The two pieces meet cleanly at WER 1: both give 0, and both have slope -1 there, so
    there is no discontinuity for the optimizer to sit on. Zero keeps its meaning —
    "as bad as saying nothing at all", since an empty hypothesis deletes every reference
    word for a WER of exactly 1. Below zero now means what it says: worse than silence.

    GEPA rewrites the instruction from this text, so it names the failure mode
    ("left disfluencies in") rather than reporting a number the reflector can't act
    on. A perfect score returns praise rather than an empty string — an empty
    reflection prompt is worse than an uninformative one.

    Which extra words count as leftover disfluencies is decided by the pair itself:
    a word the hypothesis added that was present in the input is something the
    cleanup failed to remove, while a word in neither is something it invented.
    That reads the corpus rather than a fixed filler-word list, so it stays correct
    on real transcripts whose disfluencies nobody enumerated in advance.

    Three things are deliberately **not** here, because the reflector already has them
    or is misled by them:

    - **The produced text.** GEPA's reflective dataset carries it as "Generated
      Outputs" next to the input, so repeating it is tokens for nothing — which is why
      this takes no `hypothesis` argument at all; `scored` already carries the diff.
      The reference is the one thing GEPA does not show, which is why that stays.
    - **The length budget.** It belongs in `candidates.constraint_preamble`, said once
      with the real target, not repeated on all eight examples of a minibatch — and
      said there in words against a target *below* the cap, which is the opposite of
      what a per-example "at most 2048 characters" was teaching. One run's rejected
      proposals had a median length of 2149 against that 2048.
    - **The axis nobody selected on.** Only `axis` is reported. Naming the formatting
      score on a corpus whose formatting the harness refuses to trust — `--metric
      blend` degrades to `content` on a corpus with unreliable target casing —
      invites the reflector to chase capitalization that is an artifact of how the
      targets were built.
