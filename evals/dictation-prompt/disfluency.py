"""Seeded disfluency injection — the synthetic corpus source.

Turns a clean reference transcript into the kind of verbatim text a speech-to-text
model returns when someone dictates off the cuff: fillers, repetitions, stutters,
false starts, and restarts.

Prefer a real paired corpus where one exists (see `corpus.py`) — real disfluencies
come from real speakers and this injector only knows the ones it was taught. What
injection buys that a fixed corpus can't:

- a **severity dial**, for checking whether a prompt's ranking survives more or
  less disfluent input;
- a **punctuation-restoration** task via `strip_formatting`, which no real paired
  corpus in `corpus.py` supports (their inputs and targets are punctuated alike);
- an **offline path**, so the pipeline is testable with no network.

Injection is additive by construction — every operator inserts tokens and none
rewrites or deletes reference content — so the reference is exactly recoverable by
deleting the inserted spans, and the ceiling stays at a perfect score. A candidate
that loses points really did lose them rather than being charged for damage the
injector did. `strip_formatting` is the deliberate exception: it lowercases and
unpunctuates, making formatting restoration part of the task.
