"""Find the best cleanup instruction for Blurt's dictation request.

What this optimizes
-------------------
Blurt sends one `POST /transcribe` per utterance. The request's `config.prompt`
steers *transcription*; the `config.llm` block asks the service to run an LLM
rewrite over the verbatim transcript — that rewrite is what removes disfluencies
and fixes punctuation before the text is pasted. Blurt sends `candidates.PRIOR_WINNER`
there (as `CleanupInstruction.text` on the Swift side); before that it sent an empty
`llm` object, which selects the service's own default wording. This script searches
for an instruction that beats the one shipping now.

How it measures that
--------------------
By default it uses a **real paired corpus**: `nyra`, which ships each utterance twice
— as the speaker said it and as they meant it — from Switchboard conversations whose
disfluencies trained annotators marked by hand.
Candidates are scored on how closely their output restores the intended side
(`metrics.py`). `--source builtin` swaps in a bundled sample made disfluent
synthetically (`disfluency.py`) for the offline path. See `corpus.py` for what each
source can and cannot measure.

Usage
-----
    # The defaults are a full GEPA run: 500 train rows through a small model behind
    # the AssemblyAI LLM Gateway, pruning candidates.PRIOR_WINNER under the character
    # cap, with a frontier model doing the reflection. Nothing needs passing.
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=$ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
    uv run evals/dictation-prompt/optimize_cleanup_prompt.py

    # Cheap sanity check first: rank the hand-written candidates, no search.
    uv run evals/dictation-prompt/optimize_cleanup_prompt.py --optimizer none --limit 100

    # No network and no API key — checks the pipeline end to end.
    python3 evals/dictation-prompt/optimize_cleanup_prompt.py --source builtin --dry-run

    # Against a frontier model on its own endpoint instead of the gateway.
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... uv run evals/dictation-prompt/optimize_cleanup_prompt.py \
      --model anthropic/claude-opus-5 --api-base "" --reflection-model anthropic/claude-opus-5

The length constraint
---------------------
`config.llm.instruction` is capped at `candidates.INSTRUCTION_CHARACTER_CAP`
characters and an instruction over it fails the whole request, so a winner that
doesn't fit isn't a winner. Three places enforce that, because none is sufficient
alone: the hand-written candidates are checked before any model call;
`program.CappedInstructionProposer` states the budget in its preamble and then
rejects and re-asks any proposal that misses it, which is what makes the cap a
constraint on the *search* rather than a verdict on its output; and an over-cap
result is refused at selection no matter how well it scored.

`--dry-run` and the tests need no third-party packages: everything that touches
DSPy lives in `program.py`, which is imported only after the dry-run returns.
