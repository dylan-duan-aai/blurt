"""The cleanup instructions under test.

Each is a different hypothesis about what the dictation API's rewrite model needs
to be told, and each is a complete, shippable value for `config.llm.instruction`.
They vary one thing at a time: how the task is framed, how explicitly the
disfluency types are named, how hard the do-not-rewrite constraint is pushed, and
whether formatting is called out.

`prior-winner` (`PRIOR_WINNER`) is the one that isn't a hypothesis: it is an evolved
instruction a previous run produced, compressed under `INSTRUCTION_CHARACTER_CAP`.
It is `BASELINE` — the bar a new search has to clear to be worth shipping — and the
default seed GEPA evolves from.

`guessed-default` is exactly that: a **guess** at what the service's own default
cleanup instruction might say. What Blurt actually sends is `config.llm = {}`, which
applies the service's own wording on the service's own rewrite model — and we know
neither. So it is a floor, a check that the harness can tell a terse instruction from
a careful one; beating it is *not* evidence of beating what ships today. Establishing
that would take real audio through the real endpoint, which is a different
measurement than this text-only harness performs.

Every instruction here has to fit `INSTRUCTION_CHARACTER_CAP`, or the API rejects the
whole request. That is checked before a run spends anything.

Kept in its own module so a results notebook or a re-scoring script can import the
instructions without pulling in argparse and DSPy.

#: Measured, not guessed. Told "at most 2048 characters", one run's 49 rejected

#: settling near 340 words whatever it is told. That is why this ratio is low rather
#: than merely lower — at 0.65 the ask is 216 words, and even a fifth over lands at

#: - It deletes leading `"and"`, `"but"` and `"so"` as discourse fillers. That is
