"""Score an instruction on the model that will actually apply it.

Everything else in this harness measures a *stand-in*: `--model` answers the prompt,
and whatever it prefers is what the search optimizes toward. The instruction ships to
AssemblyAI's own rewrite model, which we do not know and cannot select. Beating a
stand-in is not evidence of beating the real thing — the README has said so since the
harness was written, and until now there was nothing to do about it.

There is something to do about it. The dictation API takes audio, so:

    reference text -> `say` -> 16 kHz mono PCM -> POST /transcribe with the
    candidate as config.llm.instruction -> score `llm_response`

The response carries both sides of the question. `text` is the verbatim transcript,
so `score(reference, text)` is the floor — what pasting without any rewrite would
score. `llm_response` is that transcript after the real rewrite model applied the
real instruction, so `score(reference, llm_response)` is the number the product
actually delivers. The gap between them is what the instruction bought.

**What this does and does not establish.** The same audio is used for every candidate,
so the *ranking* is sound. The absolute numbers are not comparable to the text
harness's: synthesized speech is not dictated speech, `say` reads "um" as a word
rather than producing a real hesitation, and the STT pass introduces its own errors
before the rewrite ever runs. Read it as "does this instruction beat that one on the
real rewrite model", which is exactly the question the text harness cannot ask.

macOS only — `say` and `afconvert` are the synthesis path. There is no fallback,
because a silent switch to a different TTS would change what is being measured.
